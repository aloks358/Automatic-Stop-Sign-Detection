FILES:

baseline.py
-------------------------
Module for baseline feature extraction and for generating the corresponding linear model.

image_util.py
-------------------------
Image processing functions for converting and saving images into their individual segments.

util.py
--------
General functions for working with vectors (such as dotProduct) and machine learning (stochastic 
gradient descent, used in both the baseline and main project implementation). 

segment.py
----------------
Given an image, performs K-means based image segmentation.

segment_util.py
----------------
Contains helper code for extracting features from segmented images

train.py
----------
Takes manually labeled segments and trains a linear classifier.

video.py
-----------
Module for extracting frames from a given video and running sign classification to determine 
presence of stop signs. [Code was not used due to computational infeasibility of real-time 
segmentation/classification with K-means.]


sgd.sh
---------
A shell script for stochastic gradient descent jobs. 


example.sh
-------------------------
A template shell script for submitting a segmentation job for one image. 

generatejobs.py
-------------------------
Creates the above template shell script (example.sh) for every single image that needs 
to be segmented, and submits these jobs automatically on a cluster.


Commands to Run

Baseline
