FILES:

baseline.py
-------------------------
Module for baseline feature extraction and for generating the corresponding linear model.


image_util.py
-------------------------
Image processing functions for converting and saving images into their individual segments.


util.py
--------
General functions for working with vectors (such as dotProduct) and machine learning (stochastic
gradient descent, used in both the baseline and main project implementation).


segment_util.py
----------------
Contains helper code for extracting features from segmented images


segment.py
----------------
Given an image, performs K-means based image segmentation.


train.py
-outputs a weights.out for the linear classifier and regression analysis results
----------
Takes manually labeled segments and trains a linear classifier.


classify.py
-----------
Given an image, performs image segmentation on it and classifies each of the segments
in order to determine if the image has a stop sign or not.


video.py
-----------
Module for extracting frames from a given video and running sign classification to determine
presence of stop signs. [Code was not used due to computational infeasibility of real-time
segmentation/classification with K-means.]


sgd.sh
---------
A shell script for stochastic gradient descent jobs.


example.sh
-------------------------
A template shell script for submitting a segmentation job for one image.


generatejobs.py
-------------------------
Creates the above template shell script (example.sh) for every single image that needs
to be segmented, and submits these jobs automatically on a cluster.


Commands to Run
